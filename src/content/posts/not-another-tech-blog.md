Here lies the thoughts of a man who knows very little about tech, writes spaghetti code for a living, considers `console.log()` the ultimate form of debugging and hated all writing classes in school.

Obviously, you've landed upon the most credible blog on the web.

---

I will be using this blog to post things about tech, inclusion, and JavaScript tips/tricks. This blog will also have some <del>potentially wrong</del> opinion pieces and incomplete thoughts, but it will be content I feel needs to be released to the world. All opinions are my own and only represent my thoughts.

This is my first blog, but I'm not the first person to have a blog, nor the first person to blog about tech. Notwithstanding, I think I can bring some refreshing, innovative ideas to the tech space.

### Why?

The more that I learn about tech and coding, the more I realize that I don't understand things as much as I think I do. A way for me to deepen my understanding of certain topics would be for me to share them with others. Breaking down programming concepts into simpler explanations helps me to ensure I know what I'm talking about.

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. â€” Albert Einstein

This blog will also prevent me from sending bite-sized threads on Twitter that end up being buried in the timeline. These posts will be long-form and long-lasting. It'll give the reader a chance to learn some of my favorite coding tips/tricks and insight to some of my opinions.
