When I was in undergrad at [Jackson State University](https://www.jsums.edu) I was a part of an arts collective called Outspoken, and my choice of art was poetry. We'd meet every Sunday to catch up on our week, go through writing exercises, and audition our poems in front of the group. At the end of each piece, we'd offer critiques on what we felt would make the poem better.

One of the things we consistently emphasized was, "Show. Don't tell." Showing is using words that allow a reader to experience a text through their own imagination, while telling is giving a brief summary.

> Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass. â€” Anton Chekhov

As I progressed in my coding journey, I realized that programming is very similar to poetry. The end goal for both is to tell a story. Well... to **show** that story to a reader. I believe the most important part of telling a vivid story, in programming, is taking pride in naming variables.

Naming variables can be tough, but is indubitably worth it.
